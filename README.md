This will be my personal Project for the subject: programming basics

## Brainstorm Project

special Characters with different types of Power(attacks, defense, etc.)
If two Characters are fighting, it depends what kind of type the Character is. (i.e. Whater Character cannot win against a electricity-Character or a fire-Character cannot win against a whater-Character)
