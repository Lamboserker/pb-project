This will be my personal project for the subject: programming basics

## Brainstorm project

special characters with different types of power(attacks, defense, etc.)
If two characters are fighting, it depends what kind of type the character is. (i.e. a water character cannot win against a electricity character or a fire character cannot win against a water character)
